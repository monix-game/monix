Monix is a addictive, calming economy game where you buy, sell, and invest your way to the top!

## Development Setup

To setup a local development environment, first fork your own copy of this repository and clone it:

Also, setup a git branch to work on and initialize the pre-commit hooks:

```bash
git branch "my-amazing-feature"

npx husky install
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npx lint-staged"
```

Next, install the dependencies for the client and server:
